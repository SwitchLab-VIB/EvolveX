# Plots for count and enrichment for each CDR sequence in each round

Put the files from the folder **processed_file_after_merge.zip** and following R scripts in the same folder, then run the following R scripts: 

- **Plot_hVsig4_CDR2.R** to get the plots for all CDR2 sequences from hVsig4 selection rounds. 
- **Plot_hVsig4_CDR3.R** to get the plots for all CDR3 sequences from hVsig4 selection rounds.
- **Plot_mVsig4_CDR2.R** to get the plots for all CDR2 sequences from mVsig4 selection rounds.
- **Plot_mVsig4_CDR3.R** to get the plots for all CDR3 sequences from mVsig4 selection rounds.

Setup your own direction.
