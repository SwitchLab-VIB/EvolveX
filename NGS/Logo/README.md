# Sequence logo for mouse and human Vsig4 R1 enriched CDR sequence and negative CDR sequence

Enriched CDR designs were filtered from R1 selection for both mVsig4 and hVsig4 based on specific criteria (count > 10, enrichment factor > 10). An equivalent number of negative CDR designs were identified, defined as sequences present in the input but absent or minimally represented in the R1 selection outputs. These sequences were stored in the files **hR1_CDR2.csv, hR1NC_CDR2.csv, hR1_CDR3.csv, hR1NC_CDR3.csv, mR1_CDR2.csv, mR1NC_CDR2.csv, mR1_CDR3.csv, mR1NC_CDR3.csv**.

The following R scripts can be used to generate the sequence logo: 

- **Logo_hVsig4_CDR2.R** to get the seq logo for CDR2 sequences from hVsig4 selection rounds. 
- **Logo_hVsig4_CDR3.R** to get the seq logo for CDR3 sequences from hVsig4 selection rounds. 
- **Logo_mVsig4_CDR2.R** to get the seq logo for CDR2 sequences from mVsig4 selection rounds. 
- **Logo_mVsig4_CDR3.R** to get the seq logo for CDR3 sequences from mVsig4 selection rounds.
